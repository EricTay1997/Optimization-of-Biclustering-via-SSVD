### Package for SSVD
The optimized version of SSVD algorithm is now uploaded to [PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/ssvd-pkg-cathy10/) and ready for installation via the following command lines:

\begin{lstlisting}
pip install ssvd-pkg-cathy10
import ssvd_pkg
\end{lstlisting}

The the function "ssvd" can be called by inputting the matrix of interest and get the values of decomposition $u$, $v$, $s$.
